/*
 * The ALLOC_CACHE_ALIGN_BUFFER macro is used to allocate a buffer on the
 * stack that meets the minimum architecture alignment requirements for DMA.
 * Such a buffer is useful for DMA operations where flushing and invalidating
 * the cache before and after a read and/or write operation is required for
 * correct operations.
 *
 * When called the macro creates an array on the stack that is sized such
 * that:
 *
 * 1) The beginning of the array can be advanced enough to be aligned.
 *
 * 2) The size of the aligned portion of the array is a multiple of the minimum
 *    architecture alignment required for DMA.
 *
 * 3) The aligned portion contains enough space for the original number of
 *    elements requested.
 *
 * The macro then creates a pointer to the aligned portion of this array and
 * assigns to the pointer the address of the first element in the aligned
 * portion of the array.
 *
 * Calling the macro as:
 *
 *     ALLOC_CACHE_ALIGN_BUFFER(uint32_t, buffer, 1024);
 *
 * Will result in something similar to saying:
 *
 *     uint32_t    buffer[1024];
 *
 * The following differences exist:
 *
 * 1) The resulting buffer is guaranteed to be aligned to the value of
 *    ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN.
 *
 * 2) The buffer variable created by the macro is a pointer to the specified
 *    type, and NOT an array of the specified type.  This can be very important
 *    if you want the address of the buffer, which you probably do, to pass it
 *    to the DMA hardware.  The value of &buffer is different in the two cases.
 *    In the macro case it will be the address of the pointer, not the address
 *    of the space reserved for the buffer.  However, in the second case it
 *    would be the address of the buffer.  So if you are replacing hard coded
 *    stack buffers with this macro you need to make sure you remove the & from
 *    the locations where you are taking the address of the buffer.
 *
 * Note that the size parameter is the number of array elements to allocate,
 * not the number of bytes.
 *
 * This macro can not be used outside of function scope, or for the creation
 * of a function scoped static buffer.  It can not be used to create a cache
 * line aligned global buffer.
